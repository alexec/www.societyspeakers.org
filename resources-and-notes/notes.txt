* Used "WP-Optimize" plugin to delete all the 72k spam comments so pages load faster.
* Disabled comments.
* Removed the blog subscription link (there are only 5 subscribers).
* Removed the out of dates meeting dates from the side bar.

What are you?

I run own technology blog that has about 150k visitors a year. I've also work in IT on web sites that typically have millions of customers for 12 years.

Why change what we have?

Current state of play.

* No one was reading the awareness@ emails since October. 
* We get about 10 visitors a day to the website. Visitor read the "about us", "meetings", "FAQ" and contact us pages. 
* People search for "society speakers", "toastmasters" and "london".
* A search for "London Toastmasters" puts us at the bottom of page 2 of Google results.
* The web site takes around 3-10 seconds to load a page.
* We have 89 Twitter followers.
* I don't have information on Facebook.
* We have 46 email subscribers who open 61% of emails and click on 1% of links.

What do I (IMHO) think of this? 

* Someone (me) needs to read the emails :)
* The web site is a key acquisition tool and I'd like it to be page 1 of Google, and getting 20-30 visitors a day. 
* It is too slow to load. Google penalises slow sites: it pushes it down the listings. Slow page damage user interaction - put simple it's losing us members.
* There are four important pages that could be given a refresh. The rest could be removed.
* I'm not sure about Twitter. Followers seem to be other clubs, but I'd note that you can get emails automatically tweeted, so it'd be low effort to keep up to date.
* Emails appear to be really effective. I think we (I) should be sending them weekly.

Everything I talk about here is driven from the goal of acquiring new members and retaining existing members.

How I'd like to do this?

* I'd like us to be on page 1 of Google.
