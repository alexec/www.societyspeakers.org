                      <p><strong>Can I come along as a guest?</strong><br>
Yes, we recommend you attend as a guest before you become a member, so you can meet the other members and see for yourself how the meetings are run and if it feels right for you. You can either just turn up at 7pm on meeting days or contact <a href="mailto:awareness@societyspeakers.org">awareness@societyspeakers.org</a> if you have any questions.</p>
<p><strong>Are guests expected to participate during the meeting?</strong><br>
You will be asked to briefly introduce yourself in the middle of the meeting and you will also be offered a chance to participate in Table Topics, the impromptu speaking portion of our meeting, but you are not obligated to join in.</p>
<p><strong>When and where does Society Speakers meet?</strong><br>
Society Speakers meet at the Fitrovia Community Centre on the 1st and 3rd Wednesdays of every month at 7pm.
<p><strong>Who may join Society Speakers?</strong><br>
Society Speakers is open to anyone with an interest in improving their communication and leadership skills.  Society Speakers also offers extra support to speak about a cause or charity, to find speaking opportunities and to effectively deliver your message. So if you are interested in speaking outside the club and belong to or support a charity or cause then Society Speakers will be ideal for you.</p>
<p><strong>How much does it cost to join?</strong><br>
Toastmasters membership is extremely reasonable.</p>
<ul>
<li>A one-time, new member fee of £20 covers the cost of your Competent Communicator and Leadership manuals</li>
<li>Membership dues are then only £40 per 6 months.</li>
</ul>
